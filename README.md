Code Louisville Web Dev2 Project
Title: Sinkhole Website
Creator: Grace Kleinhelter

Description:
A webpage for a Cider and Mead business. This is composed of two html pages, the landing page that is the majority of the site, and a linked page access by clicking the "Our Meads" button. This button moves using a parallax feature and is only accessibly in the "home" element of the page. The Sinkhole Logo also acts a home button, so when on the Meads product page you can return to the home page by clicking it. The page is designed using my own artwork to give the impression of going into a sinkhole. 

Features:
-Parallax animation on scroll. This element works best when scrolling with a mouse, but does move when using the up and down arrows, or clicking on any of the navigation buttons. 

-Scrolling navigation to automatically move in-between sections based on clicking the up and down keyboard arrows. 

-Analyze text and display information in the form of a filtered product list after clicking the "Our Meads" button. This takes the viewer to a linked page where listed meads are sorted by flavor profiles, from "all" showing every available mead, to sweet, semi-sweet, dry, etc... Clicking on the flavor profiles sorts the meads. 

-Calculate and display data in the form of a fermentation countdown, with the 2023 Spring Equinox as the supposed "ready" date for the next mead. 

-Drag and drop identification game. The view can drag a salamander into a box to identify it. Each box will only accept the correct answer, and once that box has been filled will not accept any other salamander. The layout of the game adjusts to screen size. 

Current Issues: Movement and responsiveness issues. Overall appearance. Need to develop smooth scrolling.

Known issues:

-The responsiveness of the Parallax images needs work. It seems to look best at tablet size. I would like to move the "Our Meads" button into a more functional position. The side scrolling dots do not show "active" the way that I intended, and the hamburger navigation is not as fluid as I would like. 
-I would like to eventually have artwork as a footer, maybe another drag and drop game, like a trash pick-up.
